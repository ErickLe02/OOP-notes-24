You are responsible for the following:

- _[[Software Design]]_ - Definition, the two types of design (so far), where they come from, what they are concerned with
- _[[Software Design Characteristics]]_ - Know the list of characteristics
- _[[Algorithmic Decomposition]]_ - Explain what it is and how it works
- _[[Structure Diagram]]_ Given code or description, draw.
- _[[Coding Style]]_ Given function declaration or definition, improve the code using the principles we discussed in class. This includes proper parameter passing.
- _Function Design_ Given a description, create a _function declaration_ with a proper Doxygen-style comment. Parameter passing **must** follow the coding-style rules.
- #### ^^ Inside coding style
- _[[Generalizing Functions]]_ - Given an example function, show how to generalize it
- _[[Physical Organization]]_ - Include guards, header comments, function comments, separate function declarations and definitions
- _[[Naming]]_ & _Method Naming Standards_ - Given a list of names, correct the poor names
- [[_Iterator_]] - Four basic operations in GoF terms and C/C++ operators
- _[[Free-Function Stereotypes]]_ - Know the terms and be able to write a free function for each stereotype
- _Concerns_ - Definition, _separation of concerns_, be able to identify concerns
- _UML Sequence Diagram_ Given a scenario, be able to draw a sequence diagram
- _XML_ Know what is and what is not an XML concern
- _UML Class Diagram_ - C++ code ⇨ diagram, diagram ⇨ C++ code, single class only (no relationships)
- _Organizing Functions_ - free functions in a file, in a namespace, and as static methods of a class
- _[[Cohesion]]_ - Definition
- _[[Encapsulation_ and _Information Hiding_]] - Definition of each, the _encapsulation rule_ and the _information hiding rules_.
- _Member Initialization List_ - Order of field creation, proper use of member initialization list
