Decomposition
Breaking a complex problem or system into a collection of smaller parts
- Start with the initial problem or system and apply decomposition recursively
- With good design, the smaller parts improve modularity which improves maintainability
- Design answers the question: What parts do I need to solve this problem, and how do these parts relate to each other

Algorithmic Decomposition
Breaking a complex algorithm into a collection of smaller algorithms
- Start with the initial algorithm and apply alogrithm decomposition recursively
- With good design, the smaller algorithms improve modularity which improves maintability and reusability
- Design answers the question: What algorithms do i need to solve this problem and how do these algorithms relate to each other.
- possbile tradeoffs: efficiency
